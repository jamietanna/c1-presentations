# Capital One Interview Presentations

For my interviews at Capital One, I was asked to present a talk on a project I have worked on, as well as briefly explain the Cloud.

Both talks are licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 license.

The final presentation files can be found on [Github Releases](https://github.com/jamietanna/c1-presentations/releases/tag/v1). To compile the presentation, you will need your distribution's **full** `texlive` package, as well as the `make` package.
